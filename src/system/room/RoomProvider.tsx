/**
 * `<RoomProvider>` — the single owner of a room's subscription, presence, and teardown. This is
 * the component that makes `useRoom` unable to leak a listener, because a game never registers
 * one: the provider subscribes once here, and 27 v1 games' hand-rolled `listenToRoom()` (22 of
 * them leaking it) collapse into this one effect with one cleanup.
 *
 * IT OWNS THREE THINGS A GAME USED TO OWN AND FORGET:
 *
 *   1. THE SUBSCRIPTION. One `repos.room.subscribe`, torn down on unmount.
 *   2. PRESENCE. One `trackPresence`, which arms `onDisconnect` so a crashed tab is cleaned up
 *      server-side, and whose returned unsubscribe clears presence on a clean exit.
 *   3. LEAVE HYGIENE. On unmount AND on `pagehide`/`beforeunload`, it runs the pure `teardownPlan`
 *      — release my seat, drop presence, and (host only) clear chat / remove an emptied room. The
 *      plan is decided by tested logic; this just executes it, once, guarded against running twice.
